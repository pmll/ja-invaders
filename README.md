My attempt to rewrite a game that I orginally wrote when I was a kid. It's a clone of a clone.

I guess this is what a mid-life crisis looks like when you have no interest in sports cars. You rewrite a piece of software that you no longer have on cassette tape (!) for a computer that you no longer own. But hey, for some reason, old style 8 bit programming seems to be fun.
